# Simple Online Store Project

## Objective:

The objective of this project is to create a simple online store using HTML and CSS. This project will be divided among four team members, each responsible for designing and developing specific pages including About, Home, Contact, and Menu pages.

## Team Member Responsibilities:

- **About Page:** [Team Member 1]
- **Home Page:** [Team Member 2]
- **Contact Page:** [Team Member 3]
- **Menu Page:** [Team Member 4]

## Instructions:

### 1. Setting Up the Project Structure:

- Create a new directory for your project.
- Inside the project directory, create the following files:
  - `index.html` (Home Page)
  - `about.html` (About Page)
  - `contact.html` (Contact Page)
  - `menu.html` (Menu Page)
  - `style_home.css` (CSS Stylesheet for Home Page)
  - `style_about.css` (CSS Stylesheet for About Page)
  - `style_contact.css` (CSS Stylesheet for Contact Page)
  - `style_menu.css` (CSS Stylesheet for Menu Page)

### 2. Designing the Pages:

- Each team member should design the layout of their assigned page using HTML.
- Use semantic HTML elements for better structure and accessibility. Include elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, and `<section>`.
- Use HTML tables (`<table>`), ordered lists (`<ol>`), and unordered lists (`<ul>`) to organize and present content.
- Include links (`<a>`) for navigation and external references.

### 3. Styling the Pages:

- Each team member should create a separate CSS file for their respective page.
- Apply CSS styles to make the pages visually appealing.
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout design. Refer to [MDN CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout) for layout techniques.

### 4. Adding Content:

- Populate the pages with content:
  - Add relevant information and images to each page.
  - Use forms (`<form>`) for user input, such as contact forms or search bars.

### 5. Enhancing User Experience:

- Implement hover effects, transitions, or animations to improve user interaction.
- Each team member should focus on enhancing the user experience of their assigned page.

### 6. Testing:

- Test the website on different browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- Ensure responsiveness on various devices including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### 7. Branching and Merging with Git:

- Use version control with Git for collaborative development.
- Create a separate branch for each team member to work on their assigned page (`about-page`, `home-page`, `contact-page`, `menu-page`).
- After completing the tasks, merge the branches into the main branch using pull requests.
- Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise during the merging process. Refer to [Git Branching and Merging](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) for detailed instructions.

### 8. Deployment:

- Once all pages are completed and tested, deploy the website online using platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify for free hosting.

## Hint:

- Regular communication among team members is crucial for ensuring consistency and compatibility across different pages.
- Encourage code reviews and feedback sessions to maintain code quality and consistency.
